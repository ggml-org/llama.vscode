## Agent commands

### What are agent commands
Agent commands are a way to reuse often used prompts. They could be used to describe complex workflows or for simple instructions.   
Agent commands are stored in setting agent_commands and llama-vscode menu item "Agent commands..." could be used to manage them.
In future they could be extended with additional context, specificatlly prepared by llama-vscode for each command.

### How to use them
Prerequisite: tools model is selected.

In agent prompt text area press "/" - the available agent commands will be shown and could be selected. When selected, the command name is replaced with the longer prompt for this command and is sent to the AI model.  
Example:  
1. Select several lines of source code
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+A (or right click and select "llama-vscode: Show Llama Agent") - this will attach the selected lines to the prompt
3. Inside the agent prompt press "/" and select "explain"
The agent will explain the selected code. 
 
## Chat with AI about llama-vscode  

### Requred servers
- Tools server

### How to use it 
This is a conversation with the llama-vscode help agent AI about llama-vscode, something like help how to use llama-vscode.
- From llama-vscode menu select "Chat with AI about llama-vscode" -> the agent will be opened
- Enter your question about llama-vscode
The first time it could take longer to answer. The following questions will be answered faster as the help information will be cached.
 
 
## Chat with AI with project context 
This is removed. Chat with AI with project context is equal to using agent with the tool search_source. The agent has many other tools and is therefore a better choice.
 
 
## Chat with AI  

### Requred servers

## Custom eval tool

### Overview
llama-vscode provides to the users the posibility to partially create their own tool. Custom eval tool is a simple one - has one parameters and and uses the provided by the user javascript function to calculate the result.

### How to use it
Configure the description of the tool, the parameter description and provide a javascript function (one parameter, returns string) to be called when the tool is used.


Settings:
- Tool_custom_tool_eval_description: Description of the tool. This description will be used by the AI to decide if this tool should be used. Example: "Use this tool to check if a number is perfect."
- Tool_custom_eval_tool_property_description: Description of the tool only parameter. This description will be used by the AI to decide what to provide as parameter when using this tool. Example: "a natural number to check if it is perfect or not"
- Tool_custom_eval_tool_code: javascript function with one parameter, which returns string. Could be a path to a file with javascript function. Example: C:\temp\perfectNimber.js

## Custom tool

### Overview
llama-vscode provides to the users the posibility to partially create their own tool. Custom tool is a simple one - has not parameters and returns always the same result.

### How to use it
Configure the description of the tool and the returned result, enable the tool and ask the agent questions related to the tool.

Settings:
- Tool_custom_tool_description: Description of the tool. This description will be used by the AI to decide if this tool should be used. Example: "Use this tool for information about llama.cpp and llama-server - how to build it, how to use it, options, etc."
- Custom_tool_source: What should be returned by the tool. Could be file or a web page. Eample:  https://blog.steelph0enix.dev/posts/llama-cpp-guide/ â€‹The tool returns the content of the file or the web page.

## Delete models  

### Overview
Llama-vscode automatically downloads (if not yet done) models (LLMs) from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) if a local model (or env) is selected. The downloaded models are GGUF files. Once downloaded, the models are reused. The LLMs could take a lot of space on your hard disk. For example gpt-oss-20b-GGUF is 12GB.

### How to delete models
All downloaded models are stored in one standard folder:
- Windows: C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\llama.cpp.
- Mac or Linux: /users/<user_name>/Library/Caches/llama.cpp. 


You could delete the GGUF files from this folder. If they are missing, but are needed by llama-vscode, it will download them automatically again.



 
 
## Edit Agent 

### Overview
Edit agent view is used for adding and editing agents. From there it is also possible to delete and copy an existing agent as a new one. The identifier of an agent is it's name. For now there is no tools model as part of the agent (the currently selected tools model will be used)

### How to use it 
Edit existing agent:  
1. Click Select button and load an agent to be edited.
2. Change the Description and System Instructions fields (if needed)
3. Click Add Tools button and select the tools to be used for by the agent.

## Env

### What is env
Env (short for environment) is a group of models, agent and settings. Env makes it easier for the users to prepare the environment for their needs. Selecting an env with a given intent will make sure all needed servers are available. One env could contain up to 4 different models - for completions, chat, embeddings, tools. Env could also contain an agent and settings for enabling/disabling completions, rag and starting last selected env on startup. If the user wants to use only code completions functionality, he/she could select an env with only one model for completions. If the user wants to use all the functionality from llama-vscode, he/she could select an env with full package of models.

### How to use it
Select env for your needs from llama-vscode ui or from llama-vscode menu, "Select/start env...". This will select the models inside an env (and start the corresponding local servers), agent aand set the settings.
Deselect env from llama-vscode ui or from llama-vscode menu, "Deselect/stop env...". This deselect all models and agent (and stops the locally running servers, started by llama-vscode). The settings will not be changed.

There is a page in llama-vscode UI with the current environment details. From there it is possible to change the current environment and also save it (i.e. create a new env)

## How to use llama-vscode  

### Overview
llama-vscode is an extension for code completion, chat with ai and agentic coding, focused on local model usage with llama.cpp.

### How to use it 
1. Install llama.cpp  
- Show llama-vscode menu by clicking "llama-vscode" in the status bar or by Ctrl+Shift+M, and select 'Install/upgrade llama.cpp' (sometimes restart is needed to adjust the paths to llama-server)
2. Select env (group of models) for your needs from llama-vscode menu.  
- This will download (only the first time) the models and run llama.cpp servers locally (or use external servers endpoints, depends on env)
3. Start using llama-vscode  
- For code completion - just start typing (uses completion model)
- For edit code with AI - select code, right click and select 'llama-vscode Edit Selected Text with AI' (uses chat model, no tools support required)
- For chat with AI (quick questions to (local) AI instead of searching with google) - select 'Chat with AI' from llama.vscode menu (uses chat model, no tools support required, llama.cpp server should run on model endpoint.)
- For agentic coding - select 'Show Llama Agent' from llama.vscode menu (or Ctrl+Shift+A) and start typing your questions or requests (uses tools model and embeddings model for some tools, most intelligence needed, local usage supported, but you could also use external, paid providers for better results)


If you want to use llama-vscode only for code completion - you could disable RAG from   llama-vscode menu to avoid indexing files.


If you are an existing user - you could continue using llama-vscode as before.


For more details - select 'View Documentation' from llama-vscode menu

 
 
## Llama Agent 

### Requred servers
- Tools server
- Chat server (if search_source tool is used)
- Embeddings server (if search_source tool is used)

### Overview
Llama agent uses AI and tools to answer questions, change and add files and do everythin eles, which is provided by the tools.  
Llama agent is still in development, but could produce some results with intlligent models with tools support.  
Llama agent doesn't ask for permission for each change of a file. Use VS Code's Source Control view or github to review and rollback (if needed) the changes.  
Llama agent asks for permission for executing terminal command. However, if the setting Tool_permit_some_terminal_commands is enabled, it will stop asking for permissions for some commands, which are considered safe.

### How to use it 
The best wey to prepare the environment for the agent is by selecting an Env (group of models). So, below is the standard workflow:
1. Select "Show Llama Agent" from llama-vscode menu or Ctrl+Shift+A to show Llama Agent. 
2. Click "Select Env" button and select env, which supports agent, for your needes. This will download the required models and start llama.cpp servers with them. For the external servers (like OpenRouter) llama-vscode will ask for api key if needed.
3. Write your request and send it with Enter or the "Send" button.

You could also use the agent only with tools model selected. In this case the tool search_source will not work (requires chat and embeddins server)

Optional
- You could add files to the context with the @ button or just by entering "@". 
- You could select a command (predefined prompt) by pressin "/". The commands could be added frim llama-vscdoe menu - Agent commands...
- Activating an agent (Ctrl+Shift+A or from llama-vscodd menu) adds the open file to the agent context
- You could select source code and activate the agent (Ctrl+Shift+A or from llama-vscodd menu) to attach the selected lines to the context
- You could choose the tools to be used from "Select Tools" button (on the right side of "New Chat" button). If you have installed and started MCP Servers in VS Code, their tools will be available for selection too. Don't forget to click the OK button after changing the tool selection.  
- View the selected tools model from the tool tip of the "Tools Model" button and select a new tools model by clicking it.  
- View the selected agent from the tool tip of the "Agent" button and select a new agent by clicking it

Click button "Deselect Env" (vislble if there is a selected env with agent model) to deselect the env and selected models and stop the servers, which were started by llama-vscode. 
Click button "Selected Models" to show details about the selected models

## Use as local AI runner (as LM Studio, Ollama, etc.) 

### Overview
llama-vscode could be used as a local AI runner (as LM Studio, Ollama, etc.) . Models are searched in Huggingface. After a model is selected, llama-vscode automatically downloads it and starts a llama-server with it. With this the user could start chatting with an AI.

### How to use it
1. From llama-vscode menu select "Use as local AI runner" - llama view will be opened with buttons "llama.cpp", "Add", "Select", "Chat".
2. Click "llama.cpp" button to install/upgrade llama.cpp (if not yet done). The installation for Windows (with winget) and Mac (with brew) is automatic. For Linux, the user should do it manually ([download the latest llama.cpp package for Linux](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases) and add the bin folder to the PATH)
3. Click "Add" button, enter search words to see a list of models from Huggingface, select a model, select quantization. If prefered - accept to start the model immediately. (not needed if the model is already added)
4. Click "Select" button and select a model to run (not needed if the model is already started in the previous step)
5. Click "Chat" button - a web page for chat with AI will be shown in VS Code

Enjoy talking with local AI.

## Manage tools models 

### Requred servers
- No servers required

### Overview
Tools models configurations are stored and could be reused. For simplicity the term "tools models" will be used as a synonim for tools models configurations.
Tools models could be for local models (run by llama-vscode) and for externally run servers.
They have properties: name, local start command (llama-server command to start a server with this model locally), ai model (as required by the provider), endpoint, is key required  
 

Tools models configurations could be added/deleted/viewed/selected/deselected/added from huggingface/exported/imported

### How to use it 
Select "Tools models..." from llama-vscode menu  

- Add local model  
Enter the requested properties.  
Name, local start command and endpoint are required  
Use models, which support tools usage, for example gpt-oss-20b-GGUF

- Add external model    
Enter the requested properties.  
Name and endpoint are required.  
Use models, which support tools usage

- Delete models  
Select the model you want to delete from the list and delete it.

- View  
Select a model from the list to view all the details for this model

- Selected  
Select a model from the list to select it. If the model is a local one (has a command in local start command) a llama.cpp server with this model will be started. Only one Tools model could be selected at a time.

- Deselect  
Deselect the currently selected model. If the model is local, the llama.cpp server will be started.

- Add model from huggingface  
Enter search words to find a model from huggingface. If the model is selected it will be automatically downloaded (if not yet done) and a llama.cpp server will be started with it.

- Add tools model from OpenAI compatible provider  
Add tools model from OpenAI compatible provider - OpenRouter or custom (for example local/external llama.cpp server).

- Export  
A model could be exported as a .json files. This file could be shared with other users, modified if needed and imported again. Select a model to export it.

- Import  
A model could be imported from a .json file - select a file to import it. 
 
## MCP Support  

### Requred servers
- Tools server

### Overview
llama-vscode could use the the tools from the MCP servers, which are installed in VS Code (part of VS Code's Extensions view). 

### How to use it 
1. Install MCP Server in VS Code 
- Select "Extensions" view from VS Code, 
- Open MCP Servers panel
- Click "Browse MCP Servers" (at the end of the "MCP SERVERS" line)
- Select and install MCP Server
2. Start the installed MCP Server 
- From the context menu of the MCP Server select "Start Server". VS Code should recognize the tools of the MCP Server.
3. Select "Show Llama Agent" from vscode-menu or use Ctrl+Shift+A (if needed select environment with agent/tools support). 
4. Click "Select Tools" from Llama Agent panel and select the tools, which you want to use from your MCP Server


 
 
## Menu  

### Requred servers
- No servers requred

### How to use it

## Model selection

### What is model selection
At a given time only one model could be selected (no model selected is also possible). If a model is selected, llama-vscode assumes this model is available at the endpoint for this model. If the model is local, the selection of a model starts a llama.cpp server with it.

### Why is model selection needed
This way is more clear what models for what will be used.

### How to use it 
There are different ways to select a model
- In Llama Agent click the button for selecting a model (completion, chat, embeddings, tools)
- In llama-vscode menu select "Completion models..." (or chat, embeddings, tools)
- Select an env. This will select the models, which are part of the env
 
 
## Rules

### What are rules
Rules are additional user instructions that are added to the system prompt when an agent request is sent to the AI model. They are stored in a file, created by the user in a plain text or markdown format.
As llama-vscode provides the possibility to change the system prompt for the agents, additional instructions can be added to the system prompt and the result will be the same. The difference is that the rules from a file will be added to each agent system prompt on the fly.

### How to use them
The rules are optional. You could use rules file to add instructions to the system prompt - code writing conventions, code formatting, additional information about the project, etc.

There are two ways to configure rules:
- Create a new rules file under name llama-vscode-rules.md in the root of the project.
- In llama-vscode setting Agent_rules enter a path to a rules file. It could be relative to the project root or absolute path. If this is specified, the file llama-vscode-rules.md will be ignored.

## Use cases  

### Overview
The use cases below describe how to prepare and use llama-vscode in some specific cases. There are already some configurations for models and env, which could be selected and used directly

### Only completion used, local server started by llama-vscode
- Use the default configuration if it works for you by selecting Env for your case
- If you want to use a different one, here is how to prepare it:
1. Create completion model - select llama-vscode menu -> "Completion models..." -> "Add completion model from Huggingface", find the model in Huggingface and add it.
2. From llama-vscode menu select "Deselect/stop env and models"
3. Create an env, which includes only this model - from llama-vscode menu -> "Env..." -> "Add Env...". A panel will be show with buttons for selecting completion, chat, embeddings and tools models. Click "Compl" button and select the newly added model (the name is hf: model_name_from_huggingface). Test if code completion works well. Click button "Add Env" to save the environment.

### Only completion used, external server
Extarnal server could be also a local one, but is not started by llama-vscode on selecting the model. The completion server should support /infill endpoint, which is currently available only by llama.cpp.
1. Create a new model - select llama-vscode menu -> "Completion models..." -> "Add completion model...". Enter only name and endpoint.
2. From llama-vscode menu select "Deselect/stop env and models"
3. Create an env, which includes only this model - from llama-vscode menu -> "Env..." -> "Add Env...". A panel will be show with buttons for selecting completion, chat, embeddings and tools models. Click "Compl" button and select the newly added model. Test if code completion works well. Click button "Add Env" to save the environment.

### Setup llama.cpp servers for Windows  

Show llama-vscode menu (Ctrl+Shift+M) and select "Install/upgrade llama.cpp" (if not yet done). After that add/select the models you want to use.   

The instructions below are left for a reference, but now it is possible to do it easier - add a model from the menu and select it.

### Code completion server
*Used for*  
    - code completion

*LLM type*  
    - FIM (fill in the middle)  

*Instructions*
#### Install llama.cpp
```bash
`winget install llama.cpp`
```
OR  
  
Download the release files for Windows for llama.cpp from [releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases). For CPU use llama-*-bin-win-cpu-*.zip. For Nvidia: llama-*-bin-win-cuda*-x64.zip and if you don't have cuda drivers installed also cudart-llama-bin-win-cuda*-x64.zip.

#### Run llama.cpp server  
No GPUs   
```bash
`llama-server.exe --fim-qwen-1.5b-default --port 8012`  
```
With GPUs     
```bash
`llama-server.exe --fim-qwen-1.5b-default --port 8012 -ngl 99`  
```  
If you've installed llama.cpp with winget you could skip the .exe suffix and use just llama-server in the commands.  

Now you could start using llama-vscode extension for code completion.
