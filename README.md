Note: also available at [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ggml-org/llama-vscode)

### `llama.cpp` setup

Show llama-vscode menu by clicking on llama-vscode in the status bar or Ctrl+Shift+M and select "Install/Upgrade llama.cpp". This will install llama.cpp automatically for Mac and Windows. For Linux get the [latest binaries](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases) and add the bin folder to the path.

Once you have llama.cpp installed, you can select env for your needs from llama-vscode menu "Select/start env..."

Below are some details how to install llama.cpp manually (if you prefer it).

#### Mac OS

```bash
brew install llama.cpp
```

#### Windows

```bash
winget install llama.cpp
```

#### Any other OS

Either use the [latest binaries](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases) or [build llama.cpp from source](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md). For more information how to run the `llama.cpp` server, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vscode/wiki).

### llama.cpp settings

Here are recommended settings, depending on the amount of VRAM that you have:

- More than 64GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-30b-default
  ```

- More than 16GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-7b-default
  ```

- Less than 16GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-3b-default
  ```

- Less than 8GB VRAM:

  ```bash
  llama-server --fim-qwen-1.5b-default
  ```

<details>
  <summary>CPU-only configs</summary>

These are `llama-server` settings for CPU-only hardware. Note that the quality will be significantly lower:

```bash
llama-server \
    -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Q8_0-GGUF \
    --port 8012 -ub 512 -b 512 --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
```

```bash
llama-server \
    -hf ggml-org/Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Q8_0-GGUF \
    --port 8012 -ub 1024 -b 1024 --ctx-size 0 --cache-reuse 256
```
</details>

You can use any other FIM-compatible model that your system can handle. By default, the models downloaded with the `-hf` flag are stored in:

- Mac OS: `~/Library/Caches/llama.cpp/`
- Linux: `~/.cache/llama.cpp`
- Windows: `LOCALAPPDATA`

### Recommended LLMs

The plugin requires FIM-compatible models: [HF collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ggml-org/llamavim-6720fece33898ac10544ecf9)

## Llama Agent

The extension includes Llama Agent

### Features
- Llama Agent UI in Explorer view
- Works with local models - gpt-oss 20B is the best choice for now
- Could work with external models (for example from OpenRouter)
- MCP Support - could use the tools from the MCP Servers, which are installed and started in VS Code
- 9 internal tools available for use
- custom_tool - returns the content of a file or a web page
- custom_eval_tool - write your own tool in javascript (function with input and return value string)
- Attach the selection to the context
- Configure maximum loops for Llama Agent

### Usage
1. Open Llama Agent with Ctrl+Shift+A or from llama-vscode menu "Show Llama Agent"
2. Select Env with an agent if you haven't done it before. 
3. Write a query and attach files with the @ button if needed

## Implementation details

The extension aims to be very simple and lightweight and at the same time to provide high-quality and performant local FIM completions, even on consumer-grade hardware.

- The initial implementation was done by Ivaylo Gardev [@igardev](https://github.com/igardev) using the [llama.vim](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim) plugin as a reference
